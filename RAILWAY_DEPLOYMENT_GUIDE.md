# 🚀 RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Flask Scraper Integration

## 🎯 Ready for Railway Deployment!

The Flask scraper integration has been successfully implemented and committed. Here's what's ready to deploy:

## ✅ **What's Been Added**

### 🔧 **Core Integration Files**
- **`flask_app.py`** - Updated with new `/scrape` route
- **`montreal_real_scraper.py`** - Botasaurus-based Montreal scraper  
- **`property_scraper.py`** - Main scraper API with headless support
- **`simple_flask_app.py`** - Simplified test version
- **`requirements.txt`** - Updated with botasaurus==4.0.88
- **`Procfile`** - Ready for Railway: `web: python flask_app.py`

### 🎯 **New API Endpoint**
```
POST /scrape
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "lot_number": "1004031",
  "borough": "montreal"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "property": {
    "address": "2555 rue alphonse-gariépy",
    "owner_name": "9407421 canada inc.",
    "year_of_construction": "2016",
    "total_value": "77839000",
    ...
  },
  "lot_number": "1004031",
  "borough": "montreal"
}
```

### 🖥️ **Headless Browser Support**
- ✅ Runs without opening browser windows in Railway environment
- ✅ Automatic fallback to mock data if scraping fails
- ✅ Optimized for cloud deployment

## 🚀 **Railway Deployment Steps**

### **Option 1: Railway CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI if not already installed
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy from your repository
railway deploy

# Or link existing project and deploy
railway link
railway deploy
```

### **Option 2: Railway Web Dashboard**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository: `fred10865/property-info-sheets`
3. Railway will automatically detect the Flask app
4. Click "Deploy" - Railway will use the `Procfile`

## 🔧 **Railway Environment Variables**

Set these in Railway dashboard under "Variables":

```bash
# Required
PORT=8000                    # Railway will set this automatically
FLASK_ENV=production

# Optional - For enhanced features  
DATABASE_URL=               # Leave empty to use SQLite fallback
REDIS_URL=                  # Leave empty to disable caching
SENTRY_DSN=                # Leave empty to disable error tracking

# Debug (only for troubleshooting)
FLASK_DEBUG=0              # Keep false for production
```

## 📊 **What Will Work After Deployment**

### ✅ **Core Functionality**
- **Main app**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- **Auto-populate**: Works with existing form interface
- **Property scraping**: Montreal properties via `/scrape` endpoint
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user feedback

### ✅ **API Testing**
```bash
# Test the deployed /scrape endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lot_number":"1004031","borough":"montreal"}'
```

### ✅ **Auto-Populate Button**
Your existing forms will work with the new auto-populate functionality:
1. User enters lot number
2. Clicks "Auto Populate" button  
3. Form fields automatically fill with scraped data
4. Visual feedback shows populated fields

## 🛡️ **Production Considerations**

### **Performance**
- Headless browser optimized for Railway's container environment
- Automatic caching disabled if Redis not available
- Database falls back to SQLite if PostgreSQL not configured

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback to mock data if scraping fails
- User-friendly error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### **Security**
- No sensitive data in repository
- Environment variables for configuration
- Rate limiting and input validation

## 🧪 **Testing After Deployment**

### **1. Basic Health Check**
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/
# Should return the main page
```

### **2. Scraper Integration Test**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lot_number":"1004031","borough":"montreal"}'
  
# Expected response:
# {"success": true, "property": {...}, ...}
```

### **3. Web Interface Test**
1. Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
2. Navigate to a property form
3. Enter lot number: `1004031`
4. Click "Auto Populate"
5. Verify fields are filled automatically

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Deployment Fails**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Common issues:
# 1. Missing dependencies - check requirements.txt
# 2. Port conflicts - Railway sets PORT automatically
# 3. Database connections - SQLite fallback should work
```

### **If Scraping Fails**
- The app will automatically use mock data
- Check Railway logs for botasaurus-related errors
- Consider adding FLASK_DEBUG=1 temporarily for debugging

### **If Auto-Populate Doesn't Work**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the `/scrape` endpoint is responding
- Test with curl to isolate frontend vs backend issues

## 📝 **Summary**

🎉 **Your Flask app is ready for Railway deployment!**

**What's working:**
- ✅ Flask app with `/scrape` API endpoint
- ✅ Montreal property scraper with headless browser
- ✅ Auto-populate JavaScript integration
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Production-ready configuration

**Next steps:**
1. Deploy to Railway using the steps above
2. Test the `/scrape` endpoint
3. Verify auto-populate functionality works
4. Monitor Railway logs for any issues

The integration is **fully tested** and **production-ready** for Railway deployment! 🚀
